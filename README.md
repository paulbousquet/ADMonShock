# ADMonShock

This `.do` file seeks to replicate the extended series of forecasts used in the construction of the monetary shock series of [Aruoba and Drechsel (2024)](https://econweb.umd.edu/~drechsel/papers/Aruoba_Drechsel.pdf). It ammounts to an amended version of portions of Miguel Acosta's [replication code](https://github.com/miguel-acosta/RomerRomer2004) for Romer and Romer (2004).
